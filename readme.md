# Final Thoughts 

I found express very tricky in the initial stages. However,the class activity and this homework, have improved my understanding of express. I found this application to be useful in demonstrating what it is like to work on a fullstack application. I look forward to increasing my experiance working with the full stack.  

There are still technologies that i know how to use but do not fully understand. I look forward to learning more about these back-end features and how the front and back end interact with eachother.
